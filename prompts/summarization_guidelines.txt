## Summarization Guidelines

When summarizing milestone progress, follow these rules:

### Tone & Style
- Use professional, concise language suitable for executive stakeholders.
- Avoid jargon — prefer plain English.
- Be factual and specific. Do not speculate or embellish progress.

### Bullet Points (progress_summary, recent_changes, next_steps)
- Each bullet should be one clear sentence.
- Start with an action verb (e.g. "Completed", "Launched", "Resolved").
- Include concrete details (dates, metrics, names) when available in the source.
- Limit to 2-4 bullets per section. Merge related items rather than listing every detail.
- Omit bullets that repeat information already covered in another section.

### Leadership Summary
- One sentence only.
- Frame it as current status + trajectory (e.g. "On track to deliver X by Y").
- Highlight risks or blockers if they exist; otherwise emphasize progress.
- Never include task-level detail.

### What NOT to Do
- Do not invent progress that isn't supported by the notes.
- Do not include internal team chatter, debug details, or implementation specifics.
- Do not use filler phrases like "The team continues to make progress."
